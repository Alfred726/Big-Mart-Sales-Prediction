The data consists of 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined

| Variable | Description |
|----------|------------:|
| Item_Identifier | Unique product ID|
| Item_Weight | Weight of product |
| Item_Fat_Content | Whether the product is low fat or not|
| Item_Visibility | % of total display area in store allocated to this product |
| Item_Type | Category to which product belongs|
| Item_MRP | Maximum Retail Price (list price) of product|
| Outlet_Identifier | Unique store ID |
| Outlet_Establishment_Year | Year in which store was established|
| Outlet_Size | Size of the store|
| Outlet_Location_Type | Type of city in which store is located|
| Outlet_Type | Grocery store or some sort of supermarket|
| Item_Outlet_Sales| Sales of product in particular store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.|

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model to predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet

# Data Exploration and Preparation
Data exploration consisted of treatment of missing values, removal of outliers and some feature engineering
