# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
This project serves as my contribution to the open Hackathon at:

http://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-bigmart-sales-prediction

The data consists of 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined.
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model to predict sales of each product at a particular outlet.

Below is the outlook of the data.
